Answer:
A. When using brute force algorithm, it took quite a long time to find the fibonacci, so we need to use some from of dynamic programming to reuse the number of recursive calls.

B. I have made some testing with below Strings:

		String S1 = "UNITEDSTATEOFAMERICA";
		String S2 = "USA";

For brute force algorithm, the counter = 350
For LCS algorithm, the counter = 64
